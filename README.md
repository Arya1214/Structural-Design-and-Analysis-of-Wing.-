# Structural-Design-and-Analysis-of-Wing.-
The wing design and analysis process is a critical component of aircraft development, focusing on optimizing aerodynamic performance and structural integrity.
Key aspects of this project include:

Airfoil Selection: Chose NACA 64-108 airfoil to achieve optimal lift-to-drag ratio and enhance aerodynamic efficiency.
3D Wing Modeling: Developed a detailed wing model with precise geometric parameters, including aspect ratio, sweep angle, and taper ratio.
Structural Analysis: Conducted static structural evaluations to assess deformation, stress distribution, and load-bearing capacity.
Material Selection: Utilized lightweight aluminum alloy for durability, reduced weight, and compliance with industry standards.
Performance Criteria: Ensured the wing design meets mission-specific requirements, including maximum takeoff weight, cruise speed, and safety margins.
Optimization: Iterative analyses were conducted to balance aerodynamic performance with structural efficiency.
Results: Validated the wing's performance under operational conditions, achieving a safety factor above 0.5 and minimal deformation.
This comprehensive approach ensures the wing is aerodynamically efficient, structurally robust, and tailored to the needs of a Regional Transport Aircraft.
